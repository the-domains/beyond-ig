They In Disarray

One day, without warning, he was filled with the most vile.. unimaginable bitterness. It had come from the house of Maxwell and apparently had been percolating for awhile. What's inside of someone can't remain hidden forever and will eventually come out. By noon of the same day, she too was filled with a cold, dark bitterness than affected everyone and left an aftertaste that even a good tongue wiping couldn't erase. They need help. Trained, intelligent help. Who doesn't make them bitter, makes them better.
