title: "Beyond my comfort zone. I've made an effort to move the edges of my comfort zone. To go past the self imposed boundaries (not the cultural or moral ones.. just silly, limiting ones) that tend to define me as me without my even releasing it. \"I can't speak in public\", \"I don't sing out loud\", \"I refuse to fight a shark.\" Well... Now I am free to say, \"I have taken my shirt of and taken a photo.\" Personal growth doesn't always have to mean it's time to diet. "

## Beyond my comfort zone. I've made an effort to move the edges of my comfort zone. To go past the self imposed boundaries (not the cultural or moral ones.. just silly, limiting ones) that tend to define me as me without my even releasing it. "I can't speak in public", "I don't sing out loud", "I refuse to fight a shark." Well... Now I am free to say, "I have taken my shirt of and taken a photo." Personal growth doesn't always have to mean it's time to diet.
